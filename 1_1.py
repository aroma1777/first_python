### First question
### Create a simple calculator program that accepts 2 input and then displays the sum,subtraction, multiple and qotient of the two input

f1=input("Write the first number: ")
f1=int(f1)
f2=input("Write the second number: ")
f2=int(f2)

print("The sum of the two numbers is ",f1+f2)
print("The subtract of the two numbers is ",f1-f2)
print("The multiple of the two numbers is ",f1*f2)
print("The qoutient of the two number is ",f1/f2)

print("The reminder of first number divided by second number is ",f1%f2)
